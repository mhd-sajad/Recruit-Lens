# Recruit Lens — Project Explained

## Section 1: The Big Picture

### What Recruit Lens Is
Recruit Lens is an explainable, evidence-grounded candidate evaluation and recruiter platform. It assists hiring teams by ingesting a job description (JD) and a batch of resumes, extracting requirements and candidate qualifications, performing isolated hybrid retrieval of evidence, computing mathematically transparent fit scores, and producing plain-language rationale, tailored interview questions, and email drafts—all strictly grounded in cited resume excerpts.

### Objective & Who It Helps
- **Objective:** Give recruiters a reliable, fair, and fast screening copilot that eliminates manual resume skimming fatigue while preventing black-box automation errors.
- **Who It Helps:** Recruiters, hiring managers, and HR specialists who need to screen tens or hundreds of candidates with high consistency, verifiable reasoning, and zero per-resume subscription costs.

### Why It Differs from ATS Keyword Filters and Cloud Black-Box Screeners
1. **Vs. Traditional ATS Keyword Filters:**
   - Standard ATS filters perform rigid string matching. They fail when candidates use synonyms (e.g., "NodeJS" vs. "Node.js", "ML" vs. "Machine Learning") or describe accomplishments conceptually.
   - Recruit Lens utilizes hybrid keyword (BM25) and semantic retrieval backed by a standardized skills taxonomy (ESCO), capturing both exact specialized terminology and conceptual equivalents.
2. **Vs. Cloud Black-Box AI Screeners:**
   - Commercial AI screeners send sensitive personal resumes to proprietary cloud APIs, returning opaque numbers with unverified summaries and hallucinated claims.
   - Recruit Lens separates scoring from text generation: scoring is calculated through deterministic features and explainable models (never an ungrounded LLM score). Every generated explanation, interview question, and draft must explicitly cite retrieved evidence chunks and pass an automated critique check.
3. **Full HR Workflow:**
   - Rather than just producing a score spreadsheet, Recruit Lens supports the end-to-end recruiter decision journey (shortlist, interview, hold, reject, hire, scorecard recording, audit logs) while ensuring no email or decision is ever dispatched without an explicit human click.
4. **Free to Self-Host:**
   - Built to run efficiently within free-tier resource boundaries (under 400 MB RSS for the backend engine) without mandatory credit-card dependencies or paid SaaS subscriptions.

## Section 2: The Toolbox

### FastAPI (Backend Framework)
- **What it is:** A modern, high-performance web framework for building Python APIs based on standard type hints.
- **Why chosen:** High throughput, native async support, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and minimal memory overhead.
- **How it helps here:** Serves as the robust engine routing parsing, retrieval, scoring, and orchestrator tasks with structured logging and standardized error handling.
- **Alternatives considered:** Django (rejected: too heavyweight, excessive ORM overhead for lightweight ephemeral containers); Flask (rejected: lacks native async and modern type-driven schema validation).

### Pydantic & Pydantic-Settings (Configuration & Validation)
- **What it is:** Data validation and settings management library using Python type annotations.
- **Why chosen:** Enforces strict environment variable typing, validates configuration on startup, and fails fast on invalid configs.
- **How it helps here:** Completely eliminates hardcoded paths and config bugs across development, CI, and local deployment.
- **Alternatives considered:** Raw `os.environ` or `python-decouple` (rejected: lacks automatic type coercion, regex validation, and structured error diagnostics).

### Vite + React + TypeScript (Frontend)
- **What it is:** Fast next-generation frontend tooling pairing React with strict TypeScript compilation.
- **Why chosen:** Sub-second HMR, lightweight production bundles, strict type safety, and rich component ecosystem.
- **How it helps here:** Delivers the 17-screen interactive recruiter journey with keyboard accessibility, responsive state management, and clear loading/empty/error states.
- **Alternatives considered:** Streamlit (rejected: difficult to build customized, keyboard-accessible multi-step recruiter workflows and audit controls); Next.js (rejected: unnecessary SSR complexity and higher hosting overhead for a client-driven dashboard).

### uv (Python Package & Environment Manager)
- **What it is:** An extremely fast Python package manager and resolver written in Rust.
- **Why chosen:** Installs dependencies in milliseconds, deterministically locks environments with `uv.lock`, and manages Python versions without system-level conflicts.
- **How it helps here:** Guarantees identical, reproducible builds across local development and GitHub Actions CI.
- **Alternatives considered:** Poetry or Pipenv (rejected: significantly slower dependency resolution and higher disk footprint); raw pip + requirements.txt (rejected: non-deterministic transitive dependency resolution without locks).

### Pytest & Vitest (Testing Frameworks)
- **What it is:** Standard test runners for Python and TypeScript ecosystems.
- **Why chosen:** Fast test execution, rich assertion syntax, built-in coverage reporting, and seamless CI integration.
- **How it helps here:** Enforces the mandatory 80%+ coverage bar on core backend logic and validates frontend UI state handling.
- **Alternatives considered:** Unittest / Jest (rejected: slower execution speed and more complex ESM setup).

### Ruff & ESLint (Linters & Formatters)
- **What it is:** Blazing-fast linters enforcing style, safety, and modern idioms in Python and TypeScript.
- **Why chosen:** Ruff executes in milliseconds; ESLint provides comprehensive TypeScript static analysis.
- **How it helps here:** Maintains clean, strictly typed code and prevents bugs before tests even run.
- **Alternatives considered:** Flake8 + Black + Isort (rejected: slower multi-tool coordination compared to unified Ruff).

### Gitleaks (Security Secret Scanner)
- **What it is:** A dedicated SAST tool for detecting hardcoded secrets, API tokens, and private keys.
- **Why chosen:** Native GitHub Actions and pre-commit support, high accuracy, and zero secret tolerance.
- **How it helps here:** Enforces the stop-the-line security rule by preventing accidental leaks of keys or credentials.
- **Alternatives considered:** TruffleHog (rejected: heavier container requirements on lightweight CI runners).

## Section 4: What We've Built So Far (Build Log)

### Component: Frozen Product Specification (`docs/SPEC.md`)
- **What it is:** The complete, authoritative reference specification defining Recruit Lens capabilities, pipeline stages, agent roles, tiers, rules, recruiter journey screens, and data entities.
- **Why:** Establishes a frozen ground-truth contract that all subsequent implementation batches cite and adhere to without requirement drift.
- **How it works:** Stored verbatim in `docs/SPEC.md` as an immutable project baseline.
- **How it helps here:** Prevents feature creep and keeps development aligned with the 17-screen journey and strict non-goals.
- **Alternatives considered:** Scattered issue descriptions or changing README notes (rejected: leads to architectural inconsistency and scope drift).

### Component: Project-Scoped Operating Principles & Working Contract (`.agents/AGENTS.md`)
- **What it is:** Operating rules, decision principles, working contract, and global quality bars governing code quality, testing, security, and verification.
- **Why:** Codifies non-negotiable constraints: 80%+ test coverage, sub-400MB memory ceiling, evidence citations for all AI outputs, and stop-the-line security response.
- **How it works:** Extends the 10 core principles with explicit contract obligations and reporting standards.
- **How it helps here:** Keeps every incremental commit disciplined, verified with measurements, and independently reviewable.
- **Alternatives considered:** Relying on informal instructions (rejected: high risk of regressions or overlooked safety bars).

### Component: Backend Service & Dependency Lock (`backend/`)
- **What it is:** Python 3.11 FastAPI package configured via `pyproject.toml` and locked deterministically using `uv.lock`.
- **Why:** Enforces modern, typed Python with sub-second dependency installation and zero drift across developer and CI environments.
- **How it works:** Managed through `uv` with strict type checking (`mypy`), linting (`ruff`), and async testing with coverage (`pytest-cov`).
- **How it helps here:** Provides the foundation for lightning-fast backend execution while keeping RAM footprints minimal.
- **Alternatives considered:** Poetry or raw requirements.txt (rejected: Poetry is significantly slower; requirements.txt lacks deterministic dependency graph resolution).

### Component: Dynamic Environment Configuration (`backend/app/config.py` & `.env.example`)
- **What it is:** Type-safe settings management using `pydantic-settings` with zero hardcoded file paths.
- **Why:** Protects against misconfiguration, crashes early on invalid parameters, and dynamically resolves paths relative to the project root.
- **How it works:** Loads validated environment variables with constraints (e.g. port range, batch size ceilings) and auto-creates the isolated local data directory.
- **How it helps here:** Ensures portability across local machines, Docker containers, and free-tier cloud hosts without modifying code.
- **Alternatives considered:** Manual `os.getenv` lookups (rejected: no validation, silent type conversion failures, no default guarantees).

### Component: Request Correlation & PII-Safe Logging (`backend/app/middleware.py` & `backend/app/logging.py`)
- **What it is:** ContextVar-driven HTTP middleware and JSON log formatter that injects `X-Request-ID` headers into every response and redacts candidate personal data from logs.
- **Why:** Delivers end-to-end request traceability while honoring data privacy by preventing applicant emails and phone numbers from being exposed in logs.
- **How it works:** Intercepts requests, generates or preserves UUIDs, instruments response times, and passes messages through regex scrubbers before outputting JSON.
- **How it helps here:** Debugging asynchronous batch candidate runs becomes deterministic without risking GDPR/privacy leaks in logs.
- **Alternatives considered:** Standard unformatted console printing (rejected: impossible to correlate logs across concurrent async requests; risks logging candidate PII).

### Component: FastAPI Core Application & 4xx Guardrails (`backend/app/main.py`)
- **What it is:** FastAPI application instance featuring CORS controls, lifespan management, uptime health checks (`/health`, `/api/v1/ping`), and strict 4xx exception handlers.
- **Why:** Guarantees that bad client requests or malformed payloads always yield structured 4xx responses (HTTP 422/404/400) and never leak unhandled 500 server crashes.
- **How it works:** Registered custom exception handlers intercept `RequestValidationError` and `HTTPException`, returning structured JSON alongside the active `request_id`.
- **How it helps here:** Robust API contract ensures frontend recruiter screens handle input errors gracefully without unexpected disconnects.
- **Alternatives considered:** Default unformatted FastAPI exceptions (rejected: inconsistent schema, missing request ID correlation for clients).

### Component: Frontend React Client & Testing Suite (`frontend/`)
- **What it is:** Vite + React + TypeScript application adhering to strict compiler rules, keyboard accessibility standards, and Vitest component verification.
- **Why:** Delivers an interactive recruiter dashboard with labelled inputs, keyboard navigation, and explicit loading, empty, and error state handling on all views.
- **How it works:** Built with vanilla CSS design tokens, ESLint 9 flat configuration, strict TypeScript flags, and accessibility-first Testing Library suites.
- **How it helps here:** Serves as the recruiter-facing workspace for uploading resumes, inspecting cited evidence, and executing hiring workflow decisions without heavy frameworks.
- **Alternatives considered:** Streamlit UI (rejected: limited keyboard accessibility and inability to support the full 17-screen audit-driven recruiter journey).

### Component: Quality Tooling & Automated CI Pipeline (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/`)
- **What it is:** Pre-commit hooks for secret detection and linting, developer helper scripts (`scripts/run_checks.sh`), and GitHub Actions CI pipelines executing on free Ubuntu runners.
- **Why:** Prevents secret leaks before code leaves the local machine and guarantees every PR and commit on `main` satisfies quality bars (Ruff, Mypy, Pytest >=80% coverage, ESLint, TypeScript compilation, Vitest, Gitleaks).
- **How it works:** Git hooks trigger Gitleaks and Ruff; GitHub Actions workflow provisions isolated free runners for parallelized backend, frontend, and secret scanning jobs.
- **How it helps here:** Enforces the stop-the-line security rule and ensures zero regressions enter the codebase as new agents and features are introduced.
- **Alternatives considered:** Manual developer checks without automated CI (rejected: high risk of undetected broken builds, missing tests, or exposed tokens).

### Component: Project Entry Documentation (`README.md`)
- **What it is:** The root repository documentation covering platform capabilities, monorepo directory layout, developer prerequisites, setup guides, and test execution commands.
- **Why:** Provides clear orientation for any developer, reviewer, or user running the repository locally for the first time.
- **How it works:** Explains step-by-step onboarding using both automated scripts and manual CLI workflows for backend and frontend.
- **How it helps here:** Eliminates ambiguity around dependencies, port bindings, and verification commands.
- **Alternatives considered:** Minimal or auto-generated boilerplate readme (rejected: fails to communicate project context, architecture, and verification instructions).
